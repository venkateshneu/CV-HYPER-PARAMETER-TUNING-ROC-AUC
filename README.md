2Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Evaluation with ROC AUC
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation for machine learning models on the Boston Housing Price and Diabetes datasets. The focus is on optimizing model performance through systematic hyperparameter tuning and evaluating the models using the ROC AUC curve.

Datasets
Boston Housing Price Dataset: This dataset contains information about housing prices in Boston. It includes features such as crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, and pupil-teacher ratio.
Diabetes Dataset: This dataset contains information about diabetes patients, including features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels.
Key Steps
Data Preprocessing: Load the datasets and perform necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
Model Selection: Choose suitable machine learning models for the tasks (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use cross-validation to systematically search for the best hyperparameters for the chosen models.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using the ROC AUC curve to assess their performance.
Features
Cross-Validation: Efficiently tune hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
ROC AUC Curve: Visualize and interpret the performance of the models using ROC AUC curves.
Comprehensive Analysis: Provide insights into model performance and the impact of different hyperparameters.
